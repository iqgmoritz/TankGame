*This game was created as part of the Code Week 2021 at CSB System SE Germany.*
### Game Idea
The game idea is quite simple:
you control one of the tanks, which are represented by small circles in red and blue color. A line in the circle represents the barrel of the tank. You can turn this barrel to the left and right, but you can always only go along the barrel, so it's not possible to go sideways. You can fire bullets in the direction, your barrel is facing. You win by hitting the other tank with one of your bullets. There are also shield powerups spawning at random times. If you collect one of them, you gain a shield, thus giving you an extra life.

## Controls

### Player1: 

**W**: move forward

**S**: move backwards

**A**: rotate barrel left

**D**: rotate barrel right

**lShift**: fire bullet


### Player2:

**I**: move forward

**K**: move backwards

**J**: rotate barrel left

**L**: rotate barrel right

**B**: fire bullet


## Menu Keys:

**Esc**: go back to level selection

**Enter**: restart game

## Some more information and tips from my side:
- you go a bit faster when going backwards
- the player goes the same speed as the bullet, you can use this mechanic to do some kind of suicide misson or shield you off
- when going against a wall and not facing straight up, down, left or right, one of the vector movements get cancelled, but the other still is applied. You can use this to your advantage when peeking corners
